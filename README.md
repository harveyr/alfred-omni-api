===============

Alfred workflow to interact with a variety of APIs.

It is tightly coupled to my [omni-api](https://github.com/harveyr/omni-api)
repo.

For the time being, this is meant for my personal use. As such, the
only docs are:

1. run init.sh
1. run config.py

This isn't a proper Alfred export, so you'd probably need to create a workflow
and then copy this stuff into the resulting directory.
